//Instructions
//Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), 
//"legs", "tails" and "friends".

//You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, 
//"legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "GZ",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["GY"]
};
