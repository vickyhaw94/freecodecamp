//Instructions
//We can also delete properties from objects like this:

//delete ourDog.bark;

//Delete the "tails" property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation.




// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;

// Setup
var myDog = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Free Code Camp Campers"],
  "bark": "woof"
};

// Only change code below this line.
delete myDog.tails;
